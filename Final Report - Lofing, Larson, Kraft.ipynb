    "This project is based on our groups collective interest in the comparison of different AI algorithms in a game context. We were curious to see with given a game, what AI algorithm would preform better. The two algorithms used in this project are Negamax AB Pruning and Q Scaling. Connect Four was the game we used as a basis for comparing the performance of each algorithm against a variety of opponents. Opponents include random players, opposing AI algorithms, and human players. \n",

The opponents alternate placing a chip in one of the columns with the goal of getting four of their color in a row. In the physical representation of the game the board is vertical. This means when a chip is placed it goes to the lowest row.\n",

    "Negamax AB Pruning relies on the negamax function which uses a utility function to determine the best move a player could make. In this particular implementation, a winning move was assigned a value of 1, a losing move was assigned a value of -1, and a \"neutral\" move - that which would cause a tie or a non-win state was assigned a 0. These values were back-propogated through a series of move decisions, so that a move which would certainly lead to a win would be assigned a 1, a move which would certainly lead to a loss would be assigned a -1 and a move leading to a neutral board state would be assigned a 0. The negamax algorithm assumes that its opponent is using this same utility function so that it will be able to predict what the opponent will do in a given situation. This fact allows the negamax algorithm to back-propogate the value of a move through a decision tree where each node on the tree represents a board state and each branch represents a possible move.\n",
    "\n",
    "The negamax function has a high memory and time complexity if it is not limited in some way. This is especially true in the game Connect 4 where a possible decision tree would take a start state and explore each possible state of the board until a winning one is found. In order to circumvent this issue our team implemented iterative depth search and AB pruning. Iterative depth search allows the user to place a limit on how far down the decision tree the algorithm will search for a solution. It also prevents a scenario where a winning state exists one move away, but the algorithm is too busy searching down one errant path to find the simple solution. In short, AB pruning introduces the capacity for the algorithm to \"cut off\" a piece of the decision tree if it is found that the move leading to that sub-tree will not produce a winning state."

    "The AB pruning model worked very well. It is a little slow in its initial responses as it searches through the rather large list of possible solutions. This processing time decreases significantly as the game goes on. This opponent is very hard to beat. An example game play of this AI method against a user is shown below."

Ideally the lower this number, the better the algorithm. This number is not a bad number. To put it into perspective, the AB algorithm was able to beat the random player in roughly 17 moves in the example above. This would fall within the range shown for the Q Learning. As the training improves and the algorithm gets better through larger sets or different training percentages, the value would hopefully decrease. As the average number of steps decreases, the algorithm shows it is learning the game better and able to win in less moves."

To show the random player is truly random 1000 trials of two random players is given below. The results are very close to a 50/50 split. This means the random players do seem to be random and there is an equal chance that each could win. Branching off from this base case we can start to analyze the other algorithms. There were also a small number of 'Ties' showing that it is possible in the game of connect four to tie. This is extremely rare however and only took place in 0.2% of the trials."

    "Against the base case of the random player the AB algorithm did very well. It only let the random player win a small number of times. This shows that the algorithm is not perfect. It only searches a finite number of levels down to minimize the computation times for the game. Since it is not searching all of the way to the end of every case it is possible that it might lose occasionally. The number of moves that was used in the games is significantly lower than our base case of the two random players. This shows that the AB method is better than random and is able to win a significant number of times."
